# Analyzing Data
Publicly available data can be downloaded from places like [Google Public Data Explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory?hl=en) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

In the attached Jupyter notebook I look at [Android apps](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) to get a better idea of the types of apps that someone may want to focus on if they're creating a free app and want to make it available on the Google play store. 

As with most data it must be cleaned such as removing duplicates, missing rows and special characters. Then the data can be filtered into the categories you want observe, in this case, free apps that are popular (high downloads).

All the above steps are outlined in the notebook.
